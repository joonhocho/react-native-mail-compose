# react-native-mail-compose
React Native library for composing email. Wraps MFMailComposeViewController for iOS and Intent for Android.

For composing text message, check out [joonhocho/react-native-message-compose](https://github.com/joonhocho/react-native-message-compose).


## Getting started

Tested with React Native 0.43.x.

`$ react-native install react-native-mail-compose`


## Android (Manual Installation)
Theses steps are automatically done by `react-native install`.

 - Add to your `{YourApp}/android/settings.gradle`:
```
include ':react-native-mail-compose'
project(':react-native-mail-compose').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-mail-compose/android')
...other modules
```

 - Modify your `{YourApp}/android/app/build.gradle`:
```
dependencies {
    compile project(':react-native-mail-compose') // Add this
    ...other modules
}
```

 - Modify your `{YourApp}/android/app/src/main/java/com/{YourApp}/MainApplication.java`:
```
...
import com.reactlibrary.mailcompose.RNMailComposePackage; // Add this
...
public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
...
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
          new MainReactPackage(),
          new RNMailComposePackage() // Add this
          ...other modules
      );
    }
```

## iOS (Required)
These steps MUST be done manually. They are NOT done by `react-native install`.

- Make sure you have a Swift Bridging Header for your project. Here's [how to create one](http://www.learnswiftonline.com/getting-started/adding-swift-bridging-header/) if you don't.
- Open up your project in xcode and right click the package.
- Click `Add files to '{YourApp}'`.
- Select to `{YourApp}/node_modules/react-native-mail-compose/ios/RNMailCompose`.
- Click 'Add'.


Add to your Swift Bridging Header, `{YourApp}/ios/{YourApp}-Bridging-Header.h`:
```
#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>
#import <React/RCTViewManager.h>
#import <React/RCTEventEmitter.h>
```

## Usage
```javascript
import MailCompose from 'react-native-mail-compose';

// later in your code...
async sendMail() {
  try {
    await MailCompose.send({
      toRecipients: ['to1@example.com', 'to2@example.com'],
      ccRecipients: ['cc1@example.com', 'cc2@example.com'],
      bccRecipients: ['bcc1@example.com', 'bcc2@example.com'],
      subject: 'This is subject',
      text: 'This is body',
      html: '<p>This is <b>html</b> body</p>', // Or, use this if you want html body. Note that some Android mail clients / devices don't support this properly.
      attachments: [{
        filename: 'mytext', // [Optional] If not provided, UUID will be generated.
        ext: '.txt',
        mimeType: 'text/plain',
        text: 'Hello my friend', // Use this if the data is in UTF8 text.
        data: '...BASE64_ENCODED_STRING...', // Or, use this if the data is not in plain text.,
        url:'path to the file' // Use this if the data is path to the attachment file
      }],
    });
  } catch (e) {
    // e.code may be 'cannotSendMail' || 'cancelled' || 'saved' || 'failed'
  }
}
```
